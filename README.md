# Contents of the repository
* The ipynb file
* The train file (`train.csv`)
* The test file (`test.csv`)
* keras file (`best_model.h5.keras`)

## The ipynb file
* The ipynb file is where the model is trained on the train and the test set with accuracy as the performance metric.
* After downloading the repository you can directly run the ipynb file.
* The best model is stored in the `best_model.h5.keras` file
* The one provided in the repository is a pre-trained model. Once downloaded the best-trained model can retrained as you see fit.

## Use case:
* If the review and review title are two separate inputs be sure to concatenate and clean the text before passing the text into the model.
* The syntax for loading the model and preprocessing it is provided in the ipynb notebook as well.
